Fixed Issues:
    -   Debug mode: on (issue: debug mode on -> /console -> brute force) (A01:2021 â€“ Broken Access Control , A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration)
    -   Changed user/pass wrong instead of user wrong, pass wrong (issue: Username right or wrong , Tells if password is wrong) (A04:2021-Insecure Design)
